# Project 14: Grade Book (Parallel Arrays)

You are to make a two class project that will act as a teachers' grade book. The main class, will ask for 10 students names (first names only) and ask for grades for the first two assignments for the class. The frist assigment will have a letter grade, and the second assingment will have a numeric grade. It will take all the information and pass it to the server class, which will store and process the data that was collected.

After inputing all the information, the program will prompt the teacher to enter a student's name. The project will then display that student's grade on the two assignments along with the students current average. Make sure you ask the teacher if they would like to look up another student.

## Server class MUST HAVES:
```
1. 3 arrays: One for each name, letter grade assignment, numeric grade assignment
2. A method to convert letter grade to numeric grade.
3. A method to find the average.
4. A toString method. 
5. Anything else you think you'll need.
```
